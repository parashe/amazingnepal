### Internal Linking Strategy

   - “Trekking in Nepal” (trek hub)  
   - “Nepal Travel Guide” (info hub)  

2. **Spoke content**  
   - Each blog post links to 2–4 relevant **destination/trek pages** (e.g. EBC trek page, Annapurna page, Kathmandu tour).  
   - Each blog links to at least one **service/tour package** (e.g. “View our [Everest Base Camp Trek](/destination/everest-base-camp)”).  
   - Use **contextual anchor text** (e.g. “our Everest Base Camp trek package” not “click here”).  

3. **Cross-linking between blogs**  
   - “Best time to visit” → “Everest Base Camp guide,” “Annapurna itinerary,” “Monsoon trekking.”  
   - “What to pack” → “EBC guide,” “Annapurna trek,” “Nepal tour packages.”  
   - “Kathmandu guide” → “Pashupatinath tour,” “Nepal cultural tours,” “Pokhara travel guide.”  

4. **Destination/tour pages**  
   - Link back to blog guides (e.g. “Read our [Complete Kathmandu Travel Guide](/blog/kathmandu-travel-guide-2026)”).  
   - Link to related tours (e.g. EBC page → Annapurna trek, Nepal tour packages).

## 3. SEO Optimization Plan

### On-Page SEO Checklist (Per Page/Post)

- [ ] **Meta title** — 50–60 chars, main keyword near start, brand (e.g. “Visit Amazing Nepal”)  
- [ ] **Meta description** — 150–160 chars, CTA, main keyword, year where relevant  
- [ ] **H1** — One per page, includes primary keyword  
- [ ] **H2/H3** — Logical hierarchy, secondary keywords where natural  
- [ ] **URL** — Short, lowercase, hyphens, keyword-rich (e.g. `/blog/everest-base-camp-guide-2026`)  
- [ ] **Images** — Alt text for every image (describe scene + keyword if relevant)  
- [ ] **Internal links** — 2–5 to destination/tour pages + 1–2 to other blog posts  
- [ ] **External links** — 1–2 to authoritative sources (e.g. gov visa info) where helpful  
- [ ] **Content length** — Guides 1,500+ words; product/tour pages 300–600 words  
- [ ] **Mobile** — Readable font, tap targets, no intrusive popups  
- [ ] **Core Web Vitals** — LCP, FID, CLS in check (images optimized, minimal layout shift)  

### Meta Title & Description Best Practices

- **Titles:** Primary keyword first or near start; add year (2026) for “best”/“guide” content; end with “| Visit Amazing Nepal” or “| Amazing Nepal.”  
- **Descriptions:** One clear sentence on what the page offers, one benefit or CTA (“Book your trek,” “Plan your trip”), include primary keyword and a secondary if natural.  

### Heading Structure

- **H1:** One per page — e.g. “Complete Kathmandu Travel Guide 2026.”  
- **H2:** Major sections — e.g. “Why Visit Kathmandu,” “Best Time to Visit,” “3-Day Itinerary.”  
- **H3:** Subsections under H2 — e.g. “Pashupatinath Temple,” “Boudhanath Stupa.”  
- No skipping levels (e.g. H2 → H4).  

### Internal Linking Model

- **From blog to site:** Every blog post → 1 tour/destination page minimum; 1 “Nepal tour packages” or “Contact” where relevant.  
- **From site to blog:** Destination/trek pages → 1–2 related blog posts (e.g. EBC page → “Everest Base Camp guide,” “What to pack”).  
- **Between blogs:** 1–2 links per post to related guides (same category or intent).  

### Image Alt-Text Strategy

- Describe the image clearly (e.g. “View of Swayambhunath stupa at sunset, Kathmandu”).  
- Add location or activity keyword when natural (e.g. “Everest Base Camp trekker at Namche Bazaar”).  
- Avoid stuffing (e.g. “Nepal Nepal trekking Nepal packages”).  
- Decorative images: use empty alt (`alt=""`) or very short description.  

### URL Structure Suggestions

- Blog: `/blog/[topic-slug]` — e.g. `/blog/kathmandu-travel-guide-2026`, `/blog/everest-base-camp-guide`  
- Categories: `/blog/category/trekking`, `/blog/category/culture`  
- Destinations/tours: keep existing pattern (e.g. `/destination`, `/destination/[slug]`)  
- Use lowercase, hyphens, no special characters or unnecessary parameters.

## 4. Conversion Strategy

### Where to Place Call-to-Action Buttons

1. **Above the fold (hero)**  
   - Primary CTA: “View Nepal Tour Packages” or “Explore Treks” (existing Explore/search is good).  
   - Secondary: “Contact Us” or “Get a Quote.”  

2. **After key sections in blog posts**  
   - After “Why Visit” or “Best Time”: “Ready to go? [View our Nepal tours](/destination).”  
   - After itinerary: “This itinerary is based on our [Kathmandu Cultural Tour](/destination/kathmandu-cultural-tour) — enquire for dates and price.”  
   - After FAQs: Strong CTA — “Book your Nepal adventure with us” + button to Contact or Tour Packages.  

3. **Sidebar or sticky (desktop)**  
   - “Get a custom quote” or “Chat on WhatsApp” so it’s visible while scrolling long guides.  

4. **End of every blog post**  
   - One clear CTA block: headline + short benefit + button (e.g. “Plan your Nepal trip with our experts” → Contact or Tour Packages).  

5. **Destination and tour pages**  
   - “Enquire now” or “Add to enquiry” on each package; repeat at bottom of itinerary.  

6. **Exit intent (optional)**  
   - Lightweight popup or banner: “Get our Nepal trekking checklist” (lead magnet) or “Questions? WhatsApp us.”

| Informational | Guides, tips, FAQs | “Nepal travel tips 2026,” “Best time to visit” | Soft: “Explore our tours,” “Read more guides” |
| Commercial | Comparisons, “best” lists, itineraries | “Best Nepal trekking packages,” “EBC vs Annapurna” | “View packages,” “Get a quote” |
| Transactional | Tour pages, package pages, contact | “Everest Base Camp trek,” “Nepal tour packages” | “Enquire now,” “Book,” “Contact” |

Use this strategy to plan content, optimize existing pages, and align each piece with both search intent and conversion goals.
