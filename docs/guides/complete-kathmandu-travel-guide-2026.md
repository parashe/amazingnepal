## Why Visit Kathmandu

Kathmandu is more than a gateway to the Himalayas. It’s a living museum of Hindu and Buddhist heritage, with centuries-old temples, stupas, and palaces set against a backdrop of busy bazaars and mountain views. The Kathmandu Valley holds seven UNESCO World Heritage sites, and the city’s mix of spirituality, history, and street life makes it one of the most memorable stops on any [Nepal tour package](/destination).

You’ll get a real sense of Nepali culture here—whether you’re spinning prayer wheels at Boudhanath, watching rituals at Pashupatinath, or exploring the old royal squares. Many of our [Nepal cultural tours](/destination) and [pilgrimage itineraries](/destination) start or end in Kathmandu, so a good understanding of the city will enrich your whole trip.

## Top Things to Do in Kathmandu

- **Explore the Durbar Squares** — Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur each have a Durbar Square with palaces, temples, and courtyards. Kathmandu’s is in the heart of the old city; Patan and Bhaktapur are short trips from the centre.
- **Visit Swayambhunath (Monkey Temple)** — The hilltop stupa offers 360° views and a classic introduction to Buddhist and Hindu coexistence. Go early for fewer crowds.
- **Walk around Boudhanath Stupa** — One of the largest stupas in the world and a centre of Tibetan Buddhism. Perfect for a morning or evening kora (circumambulation).
- **Experience Pashupatinath Temple** — Nepal’s most sacred Hindu temple complex, on the Bagmati River. Non-Hindus can’t enter the main shrine but can observe rituals and explore the outer areas.
- **Wander Thamel and the old city** — Thamel is the main tourist hub for gear, food, and cafes; the surrounding alleys lead into older neighbourhoods and local markets.
- **Day trip to Bhaktapur or Patan** — Both cities offer stunning Durbar Squares and pottery, weaving, and metalwork. Easy to combine with a half-day [cultural tour](/destination).
- **Try a cooking class or food walk** — Learn to make momos or dal bhat and taste street snacks with a local guide.

## Best Time to Visit Kathmandu

The best time to visit Kathmandu is **October–November** (post-monsoon) and **March–April** (spring). Skies are clear, temperatures are mild, and it’s ideal for both sightseeing and starting treks like the [Everest Base Camp](/destination) or [Annapurna Circuit](/destination).

**Winter** (December–February) is cool and dry—great for culture and heritage; pack a warm layer for mornings and evenings. **Monsoon** (June–September) brings rain and humidity; temples and bazaars are still rewarding, but mountain views are often hidden. For more on seasons and trekking windows, see our guide on the [best time to visit Nepal](/blog/best-time-to-visit-nepal).

## How to Get There

**By air:** Tribhuvan International Airport (KTM) is Nepal’s only international airport. Direct and connecting flights from the UK, Europe, India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia land here. Many of our [Nepal tour packages from the UK](/destination) include airport transfers.

**Overland:** From India you can enter by bus (e.g. from Varanasi or Gorakhpur). Border formalities and road conditions vary; allow extra time. For first-time visitors, flying into Kathmandu is usually the simplest option.

### Getting Around Kathmandu

Within the city, taxis are the most common choice for visitors—agree a price before setting off or use a pre-arranged transfer. Thamel and the main heritage sites are also reachable on foot if you’re based centrally. For Swayambhunath, Boudhanath, Pashupatinath, and the Patan/Bhaktapur Durbar Squares, many travellers join a guided [Kathmandu cultural tour](/destination), which includes transport and avoids haggling. Local buses and microbuses are cheap but crowded and tricky for first-timers; rickshaws are better for short hops in the old city. If you’re heading to Pokhara or a trek, private transfers or domestic flights from Kathmandu are straightforward—we can include these in your [Nepal tour package](/destination).

## Travel Costs & Budget Tips

- **Accommodation:** Thamel has options from budget hostels (£5–15/night) to mid-range hotels (£25–60) and a few upscale properties. Heritage stays in Patan or Bhaktapur cost a bit more but add atmosphere.
- **Food:** Local meals (dal bhat, momos, thukpa) cost £2–5; tourist-area restaurants £5–12. Street snacks and tea are very cheap.
- **Sightseeing:** UNESCO site tickets (e.g. Durbar Squares, Swayambhunath, Boudhanath, Pashupatinath) are sold as single-entry or composite passes. Budget roughly £15–25 for the main sites.
- **Transport:** Taxis from the airport to Thamel are fixed-price (bargain or use a pre-booked transfer). In town, short rides are cheap; day trips to Patan/Bhaktapur by taxi or organised tour cost more but save time.
- **Tip:** Booking a [Kathmandu cultural tour](/destination) that includes entry fees and transport often works out better value and saves queueing.

## Practical Travel Tips

### Visas

UK and most nationals get a **Nepal visa on arrival** at the airport (or at land borders). Bring a passport photo and cash (USD preferred). E-visa online is also available. Check current rules and length of stay before you travel.

### Safety

Kathmandu is generally safe for travellers. Use normal precautions: watch bags in crowds, avoid unlit alleys at night, and use registered taxis or app-based rides where available. Tap water is not safe to drink—use bottled or filtered water.

### Packing

Light layers work best: warm layer for winter mornings/evenings, sun hat and sunscreen for daytime, comfortable shoes for temple steps and uneven streets. If you’re continuing to a trek, you can rent or buy gear in Thamel; our [Nepal trekking packing list](/blog/nepal-trekking-packing-list) covers both city and trail.

### Culture

Dress modestly at temples (shoulders and knees covered). Remove shoes where indicated; don’t point feet at shrines or people. Ask before photographing people or rituals. A few words of Nepali (e.g. *namaste*, *dhanyabad*) go a long way.
