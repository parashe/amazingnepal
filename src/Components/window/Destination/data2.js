The valley widens now as the trail crosses Phangkha, where an avalanche in 1995 killed 40 people. Then, we will go down to the edge of the river before climbing the moraine terminal of the Ngazumpa glacier by a steep path. Crossing an iron bridge over a stream, the trail rises as you follow the valley and pass the first lake, called Longpongo, at 4690m. At this point, we have the opportunity to observe the footsteps of a lama on a stone. Seeing the second lake, Taboche Tsho, we will be hypnotized by the shining sheet of turquoise blue water that shines in the sun. Shortly before the second lake, we reached the third lake, both connected by an updraft. The village of Gokyo is located next to the third lake and Cho-Oyu Mountain as a backdrop and offers amazing spectacular views. After lunch, we explore the third lake, Dudh Pokhari. Night in Gokyo.",

        "Makalu is the fifth highest mountain in the world (8,481 m), but the trek to its base camp is a less travelled route due to its relative inaccessibility. The Makalu Base Camp trekking route is situated in the Makalu Barun National Park and Conservation Area, which is located in the heart of eastern Nepal. The main focus of this trek is the Makalu Barun National Park, located in the districts of Solukhumbu and Sankhuwasabha. The national park was founded in 1992. Previously, the Makalu trek was a restricted trekking area. It spans five major ecological zones, including the lush, tropical Arun valley, dense forests, rhododendrons, firs, and alpine meadows that lead to the massive Barun glacier. The main highlights of this trekking region are Chamlang Himal and the Barun Valley. The trekking areas of Makalu and Everest are not far apart. Trekking to Makalu Base Camp is a unique challenge. The Makalu Base Camp trek is one of Nepal's most remote and unexplored trekking areas. Natural wonders abound in the Makalu region. It stretches across many regions, where the cold of the mountain is chilling and the beauty of the mountain has an invincible air. Beautiful mountains, pristine forests, a diverse plant and animal life, and simple and warm-hearted people with rich and varied customs are among the highlights of this rich natural paradise. The Makalu Barun National Park is home to 3,000 plant species, 440 bird species, and 75 mammal species, including the snow leopard, red panda, musk deer, wild boar, wild yak, and Himalayan Thar. With the possibility of seeing wildlife at lower altitudes, green pastures and fields, villages and forests, as well as snow-capped mountains, glaciers, and rocky trails, this is also an ideal photography location. As a result, the Makalu trek is yet another popular trekking destination in Nepal.",

Located just at the east of Nepal's, the most popular treks Mardi Himal is a hidden gem in the Annapurna region. Few hikers go to the Mardi Himal base camp located dramatically at the base of Mardi Himal and the impressive Machapuchhre. Another benefit of this trekking is that the trail has a small circuit to the Mardi Himal base camp so that we do not have to go back to the same terrain.
